The general description of my final project is an object detector (basically any object that isn't in the background of the image). The user should be able to provide a filepath to an image, and the program will locate all the objects in the picture. If time permits, I can extend this to where the user can input multiple images and the program will find and store the objects in all the images. Extensions in the line of classifying or relating the found objects with each other can also be added once the initial detector is created. My ideas for this include determining whether two objects are the same (there is a human figure in both images), finding the darkest/brightest object in the image, finding the object furthest in the front, etc. To identify the images, I am using the ofxCv library. The ContourFinder file in the library is used to locate each object, which uses the findContours method to find/store them. This library needed to be added to the add-ons folder in openFrameworks. Thus, I will be referring to the github link for info about the usage of each class/method in the library (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv). I will also be using https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html to help with the algorithm to find the darkest objects and the closest objects.
