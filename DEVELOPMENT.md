I was able to load an image into the program and use the findContours method on it. This was a simple picture with just a single object.

I changed my project idea to a 3d checkers game. The initial version of this game involves having 3 checkers boards on top of each other. Setting this display up was a bit of a struggle as I tried various ways to represent this. I first tried binding a texture (image) to a 3d/2d rectangle to represent the board, but this wasn't working. I then solved this by solely drawing 3 textures. Another issue I have been running into is how to specify the correct orientation of the board when the game starts and how to properly rotate the camera around the boards.
